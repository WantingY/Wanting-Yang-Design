			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Our team began by working off the inspiration that suddenly, due to the Coronavirus pandemic many parents with school age children are working from home.  The parents must find a way to help their kids while still trying to perform their work duties and children must be able to stay busy with productive work allowing parents to do their job. After a few revisions we arrived at the <strong>problems statement</strong> that</p>
			<p class="feature-text">"Due to the unprecedented Coronavirus pandemic, families have been forced to be at home with little time to prepare for homeschooling and the social isolation.  Parents are trying to balance working from home and schooling their children simultaneously.</p>
			<p class="feature-text">Therefore, they are facing problems with time management, entertainment, excess energy and productivity."</p>

			<h3>Interviews</h3>
			<h4>Target users</h4>
			<ul class="article-bullet">
				<li>People that work from home with children</li>

			</ul>

			<h4>Insights Obtained from Interviews</h4>
			<ul class="article-bullet">
				<li>Frequent interruptions leads to less productivity.</li>
				<li>Many Kids are tech savvy enough to perform basic functions on a piece of technology on their own but should be in elementary school range from 5-11 years.</li>
				<li>Many kids have access to a tech device and often are being assigned ipads as young as elementary schools by the school.</li>
				<li>Parents are more willing to bend some of their rules during times where they need to keep the children busy so they can focus.</li>
				<li>Kids are bored and miss their friends.</li>
				<li>There are more issues in the afternoon.</li>
				<li>Parents aren’t abiding by a set work schedule and don’t have set breaks.</li>
				<li>Many families are waking up and starting their day later.</li>
				<li>Kids have excess energy from lack of stimulation.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We have two distinct users who needs overlap but they must be approached from different angles keeping in mind simplicity and ease for both a more advanced parental user and a less tech savvy child user who needs more graphic and colorful interfaces. Keeping it simple and engaging is a top concern to for the child.</p>	

			<h4>Behavior We Want to Influences</h4>
			<div class="article-style">
				<p><strong>Parent</strong> - feel confident stepping away from their kids and more uninterrupted  work time.</p>
				<p><strong>Kids</strong> - Ability to self start homework or chores, to find their own entertainment to prevent boredom and need to  interrupt the parents.</p>

			<h3>Ideation</h3>
			<img src="images/towersketch.png" alt="towersketch">
			<p>Our team focused on the schedule after difficulty with finding a ideal solution for the live helper. Many parents interviewed did not frequently leave their children alone with strangers and the challenge of giving someone full  time live access to monitor the interior of your house was challenging. We kept it incorporated more as a side feature, giving the parent access to schedule a specific time of day with a tutor at times they needed more help.</p>
